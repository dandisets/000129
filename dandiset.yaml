description: This dataset contains sorted unit spiking times and behavioral data from
  a macaque performing a self-paced reaching task. In the experimental task, the subject
  reached between targets randomly selected from an 8x8 grid without gaps or pre-movement
  delay intervals. Neural activity was recorded from an electrode array implanted
  in the primary motor cortex. Finger position, cursor position, and target position
  were also recorded during the experiment.
